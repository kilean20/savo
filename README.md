# SAVO: Surogate gradient Assisted Very-high-dimensional Optimization

Exploit averaged (over the neighborhood of current decision parameter) gradient of surrogate model (trained over data obtained on the fly)
Exploit Extremum Seeking algorithm for initial data collection for surrogate modeling
Best applied for not so expensive high dimensional objectives that costs around 1 second to evaulate.
